The wars are often categorised into five conflicts, each termed after the coalition that fought Napoleon: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_the_Third_Coalition" title="Congress of Vienna">Third Coalition</a> (1805), the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_the_Fourth_Coalition" title="French Revolution">Fourth</a> (1806–07), the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_the_Fifth_Coalition" title="War of the Fifth Coalition">Fifth</a> (1809), the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_the_Sixth_Coalition" title="War of the Sixth Coalition">Sixth</a> (1813–14), and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_Days" title="Hundred Days">Seventh</a> (1815).</p><p>Napoleon, upon <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup_of_18_Brumaire" title="Coup of 18 Brumaire">ascending to First Consul of France</a> in 1799, had inherited a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_First_Republic" title="French First Republic">republic in chaos</a>; he subsequently created a state with stable finances, a strong bureaucracy, and a well-trained army. In 1805, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_Empire" title="Austrian Empire">Austria</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Empire" title="Russian Empire">Russia</a> formed the Third Coalition and waged war against France. In response, Napoleon defeated the allied Russo-Austrian army at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Austerlitz" title="Battle of Austerlitz">Austerlitz</a> in December 1805, which is considered his greatest victory. At sea, the British severely defeated the joint Franco-Spanish navy in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Trafalgar" title="Peninsular War">Battle of Trafalgar</a> on 21 October 1805. This victory secured British <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_of_the_sea" title="Command of the sea">control of the seas</a> and prevented the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon%27s_planned_invasion_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="Napoleon's planned invasion of the United Kingdom">invasion of Britain itself</a>. Concerned about increasing French power, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Prussia" title="Kingdom of Prussia">Prussia</a> led the creation of the Fourth Coalition with Russia, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Saxony" title="Kingdom of Saxony">Saxony</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden" title="Sweden">Sweden</a>, and the resumption of war in October 1806. Napoleon quickly defeated the Prussians at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Jena%E2%80%93Auerstedt" title="Battle of Jena–Auerstedt">Jena</a> and the Russians at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Friedland">Friedland</a>, bringing an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaties_of_Tilsit">uneasy peace</a> to the continent. The peace failed, though, as war broke out in 1809, with the badly prepared Fifth Coalition, led by Austria. At first, the Austrians won a stunning victory at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Aspern-Essling" title="Battle of Aspern-Essling">Aspern-Essling</a>, but were quickly defeated at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Wagram" title="Battle of Wagram">Wagram</a>.</p><p>Hoping to isolate and weaken Britain economically through his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_System" title="Continental System">Continental System</a>, Napoleon launched an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_of_Portugal_(1807)" title="Invasion of Portugal (1807)">invasion of Portugal</a>, the only remaining British ally in continental Europe. After occupying Lisbon in November 1807, and with the bulk of French troops present in Spain, Napoleon seized the opportunity to turn against his former ally, depose the reigning <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_royal_family" title="Spanish royal family">Spanish royal family</a> and declare his brother King of Spain in 1808 as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Bonaparte" title="Joseph Bonaparte">José I</a>. The Spanish and Portuguese revolted with British support and expelled the French from Iberia in 1814 after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peninsular_War">six years of fighting</a>.</p><p>Concurrently, Russia, unwilling to bear the economic consequences of reduced trade, routinely violated the Continental System, prompting Napoleon to launch a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_invasion_of_Russia" title="French invasion of Russia">massive invasion of Russia</a> in 1812. The resulting campaign ended in disaster and the near destruction of Napoleon's <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grande_Arm%C3%A9e" title="Grande Armée">Grande Armée</a></i>.</p><p>Encouraged by the defeat, Austria, Prussia, Sweden, and Russia formed the Sixth Coalition and began a new campaign against France, decisively defeating Napoleon at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Leipzig" title="Battle of Leipzig">Leipzig</a> in October 1813 after several inconclusive engagements. The Allies then invaded France from the east, while the Peninsular War spilled over into southwestern France. Coalition troops captured Paris at the end of March 1814 and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Fontainebleau_(1814)" title="Battle of Trafalgar">forced Napoleon to abdicate</a> in April. He was exiled to the island of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principality_of_Elba" title="Principality of Elba">Elba</a>, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourbon_Restoration_in_France">Bourbons were restored to power</a>. But Napoleon escaped in February 1815, and reassumed control of France for around <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_Days" title="Hundred Days">one hundred days</a>. After forming the Seventh Coalition, the Allies defeated him permanently at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Waterloo" title="Battle of Waterloo">Waterloo</a> in June 1815 and exiled him to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Helena" title="Bourbon Restoration in France">Saint Helena</a>, where he died six years later.<sup id="cite_ref-zamoy_66-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleonic_Wars#cite_note-zamoy-66">[30]</a></sup></p><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congress_of_Vienna">Congress of Vienna</a> redrew the borders of Europe and brought a period of relative peace.

Among the reasons were Napoleon's changes to the international system in Western Europe, especially in Switzerland, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands. Historian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Kagan" title="Frederick Kagan">Frederick Kagan</a> argues that Britain was irritated in particular by Napoleon's assertion of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland_in_the_Napoleonic_era" title="Switzerland in the Napoleonic era">control over Switzerland</a>. Furthermore, Britons felt insulted when Napoleon stated that their country deserved no voice in European affairs, even though King George III was an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince-elector" title="Prince-elector">elector</a> of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire" title="Holy Roman Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a>. For its part, Russia decided that the intervention in Switzerland indicated that Napoleon was not looking toward a peaceful resolution of his differences with the other European powers.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEKagan200742-43_68-1" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleonic_Wars#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKagan200742-43-68">[32]</a></sup></p><p>The British hastily enforced a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naval_blockade" class="mw-redirect" title="Naval blockade">naval blockade</a> of France to starve it of resources. Napoleon responded with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_System" title="Battle of Friedland">economic embargoes against Britain</a>, and sought to eliminate Britain's Continental allies to break the coalitions arrayed against him. The so-called <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_System" title="Continental System">Continental System</a></i> formed a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_League_of_Armed_Neutrality">league of armed neutrality</a> to disrupt the blockade and enforce <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_trade" title="Free trade">free trade</a> with France.

Within months, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Prussia" title="Kingdom of Prussia">Prussia</a> declared war, triggering a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_the_Fourth_Coalition" title="War of the Fourth Coalition">War of the Fourth Coalition</a>. This war ended disastrously for Prussia, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Jena%E2%80%93Auerstedt" title="Battle of Jena–Auerstedt">defeated and occupied</a> within 19 days of the beginning of the campaign. Napoleon subsequently defeated Russia at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Friedland" title="Battle of Friedland">Friedland</a>, creating powerful client states in Eastern Europe and ending the fourth coalition.</p><p>Concurrently, the refusal of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_Empire" title="Portuguese Empire">Portugal</a> to commit to the Continental System, and Spain's failure to maintain it led to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peninsular_War" title="Peninsular War">Peninsular War</a> and the outbreak of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_the_Fifth_Coalition" title="War of the Fifth Coalition">War of the Fifth Coalition</a>. The French occupied Spain and formed a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Spain_under_Joseph_Bonaparte" class="mw-redirect" title="Kingdom of Spain under Joseph Bonaparte">Spanish client kingdom</a>, ending the alliance between the two. Heavy British involvement in the Iberian Peninsula soon followed while a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walcheren_Expedition" class="mw-redirect" title="Walcheren Expedition">British effort to capture Antwerp</a> failed. Napoleon oversaw the situation in Iberia, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Somosierra" title="Battle of Somosierra">defeating the Spanish</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Corunna" title="Battle of Corunna">expelling the British</a> from the Peninsula. Austria, keen to recover territory lost during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_the_Third_Coalition" title="War of the Third Coalition">War of the Third Coalition</a>, invaded France's client states in Eastern Europe. Napoleon defeated the fifth coalition at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Wagram" title="Battle of Wagram">Wagram</a>.</p><p>Anger at British naval actions led the United States to declare war on Britain in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_1812" title="War of 1812">War of 1812</a>, but it did not become an ally of France. Grievances over control of Poland, and Russia's withdrawal from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_System" title="Continental System">Continental System</a>, led to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_invasion_of_Russia" title="French invasion of Russia">Napoleon invading Russia</a> in June 1812.

Napoleon suffered further setbacks; French power in the Iberian Peninsula was broken at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Vitoria" title="Battle of Vitoria">Battle of Vitoria</a> the following summer, and a new coalition began the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_the_Sixth_Coalition" title="War of the Sixth Coalition">War of the Sixth Coalition</a>.</p><p>The coalition defeated Napoleon at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Leipzig" title="Battle of Leipzig">Leipzig</a>, precipitating his fall from power and eventual abdication on 6 April 1814.

Napoleon escaped from Elba in 1815, gathering enough support to overthrow the monarchy of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_XVIII" title="Louis XVIII">Louis XVIII</a>, triggering a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_the_Seventh_Coalition" class="mw-redirect">seventh, and final, coalition against him</a>.

McLynn concludes that it proved to be the right choice for Britain because, in the long run, Napoleon's intentions were hostile to the British national interest.

I say only they will not come by sea"), Britain did not have to spend the entire war defending itself and could therefore focus on supporting its embattled allies, maintaining low-intensity land warfare on a global scale for over a decade.

Britain maintained a standing army of 220,000 at the height of the Napoleonic Wars, of whom less than half were available for campaigning. The rest were necessary for garrisoning Ireland and the colonies and providing security for Britain. France's strength peaked at around 2,500,000 full-time and part-time soldiers including several hundred thousand National Guardsmen whom Napoleon could draft into the military if necessary. Both nations enlisted large numbers of sedentary militia who were unsuited for campaigning and were mostly employed to release regular forces for active duty.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEKennedy1989128-129_113-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleonic_Wars#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKennedy1989128-129-113">[77]</a></sup></p><p>The Royal Navy disrupted France's extra-continental trade by seizing and threatening French shipping and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_colonial_empire" title="French colonial empire">colonial possessions</a>, but could do nothing about France's trade with the major continental economies and posed little threat to French territory in Europe. France's population and agricultural capacity far outstripped that of Britain. Britain had the greatest industrial capacity in Europe, and its mastery of the seas allowed it to build up considerable economic strength through trade. This ensured that France could never consolidate its control over Europe in peace.

With the withdrawal of Austria from the war, stalemate ensued. Napoleon's army had a record of continuous unbroken victories on land, but the full force of the Russian army had not yet come into play. Napoleon had now consolidated his hold on France, had taken control of Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and most of Western Germany and northern Italy. His admirers say that Napoleon wanted to stop now, but was forced to continue in order to gain greater security from the countries that refused to accept his conquests. Esdaile rejects that explanation and instead says that it was a good time to stop expansion, for the major powers were ready to accept Napoleon as he was:</p><dl><dd>in 1806 both Russia and Britain had been positively eager to make peace, and they might well have agreed to terms that would have left the Napoleonic imperium almost completely intact. As for Austria and Prussia, they simply wanted to be left alone. To have secured a compromise peace, then, would have been comparatively easy. But Napoleon was prepared to make no concessions.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEEsdaile2009252–253_129-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleonic_Wars#cite_note-FOOTNOTEEsdaile2009252%E2%80%93253-129">[92]</a></sup></dd></dl><p class="align-left"><span style="color: #e03e2d;">Copyright from Wikipedia, 2021</span></p></div><aside class="post__aside"><div class="post__last-updated u-small">This article was updated on August 11, 2021</div><div class="post__share"></div></aside><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__bio box"><div><h4 class="h6"><a href="https://thoriqjameel.github.io/maldiv/authors/thori/" title="thori">thori</a></h4></div></div><nav class="post__nav box"><div class="post__nav__prev"><a href="https://thoriqjameel.github.io/maldiv/new-maps-found-on-internet.html" class="post__nav__link" rel="prev"><div class="u-small">Previous Post<h5>New Maps Found on Internet</h5></div></a></div><div class="post__nav__next"><a href="https://thoriqjameel.github.io/maldiv/veksin-nujahaa-tooristunnash-rashrashash-dhevey-usoole-hadhaifi.html" class="post__nav__link" rel="next"><div class="u-small">Next Post<h5>ވެކްސިން ނުޖަހާ ޓޫރިސްޓުންނަށް ރަށްރަށަށް ދެވޭ އުސޫލެއް ހަދައިފި</h5></div></a></div></nav></footer></article></main><div class="sidebar"><section class="box authors"><h3 class="box__title">Authors</h3><ul class="authors__cotainer"><li class="authors__item"><div><a href="https://thoriqjameel.github.io/maldiv/authors/thori/" class="authors__title">thori</a> <span class="u-small">Post: 10</span></div></li></ul></section><section class="newsletter box box--gray"><h3 class="box__title">Newsletter</h3><p class="newsletter__description">Sign up to receive email updates and to hear what's going on with us!</p><form>...</form></section></div><footer class="footer"><a class="footer__logo" href="https://thoriqjameel.github.io/maldiv/">maldivxyz.netlify.app</a><nav><ul class="footer__nav"></ul></nav><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by <a href="https://getpublii.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Publii</a></div></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
